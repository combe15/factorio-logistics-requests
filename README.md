# factorio-logistics-requests
This is a lua code generator for factorio logistics requests commands. We want to be able to share sets of logistics requests between friends so we made a tool to help exchange logistics requests settings. It makes a command you can run, so you will need admin in game to run it. Maybe this works for you and your multiplayer setting/playmates, or maybe it doesn't (sorry!). 

Enjoy!
